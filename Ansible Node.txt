After installing Ansible in the Control server we need to create keygen and copy the same in to host servers
for ssh connection

1)Command :

$ssh-keygen

2)Create the host inventory file

$ sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts

edit the default host file and write the host names

3) Copy the ssh key to the node that we have mentioned in the Host Inventory file

$ssh-copy-id -i knode

4) Check if the node is responding properly

$ansible -m ping test-server

5) Write the playbook

$ sudo nano testdemo.yml

[text editor opens up]


---
- host : test-servers
  become: true
  vars:
    ansible_become_pass: password
  task :
  - name : install nginx
    package : pkg=nginx state=install

    notify:
    - start nginx

  handlers :
  - name = start nginx
    service : name=nginx state=started

6) Now we need to run te playbook file

$ansible-playbook testdemo.yml

7) To verify whether the package has been installed we need to use the command:

$ps waux | grep ngix  // we need to login to the node server beforehand
