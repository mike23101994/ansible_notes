Modules (also referred to as “task plugins” or “library plugins”) are discrete units of code that can be used from the command line or in a playbook task. Ansible executes each module, usually on the remote target node, and collects return value.

to execute the midules using command line:

$ansible all -m ping

$ansible webservers -m command -a "ls"

$ansible -i inventory all -m command -a "iptables -F" --become --ask-become-pass

$ansible all -m setup

$ansible-doc setup
