We use the conditional statement in Ansible by using "when" keyword

---
  - name: Install NGINX 
    host: all
    tasks:  
      - name: INSTALL Nginx in Debian
        apt:
          name: nginx
          state: present
          when: ansible_os_family == 'Debian' or ansible_distribution_version == '16.06'
          
       - name: INSTALL Nginx in Redhat or SUSE
         yum:
            name: nginx
            state: present
            when: ansible_os_family == 'Redhat'

 To write a playbook to check the http status
 
 
 ---
    - name: Check the http status in the server
      host: all
      task:
        name: Checking the https status
        - command: service https status
            resgister : result
        - mail:
            to: mainak@gmail.com
            subject: HTTPS STatus
            body: the service is down
            
            when: result.stdout.find('down') != -1
            
            
            
            
   ####Note
   
   we dont need to put variables in {{}} while using them in conditions
   
   for example:
   
   var:
      age: 25
      
   -task:
        - command:
            cmd: echo"i am a child"
            when: age < 18
        - command:
              cmd: echo"i am an adult"
              when: age>= 18
